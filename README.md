# Doggio

# Overview
This will be an app for dog owners. It will track things like: when to get certain vaccines, when they have been fed, how much food they are eating or need to eat, keep track of when they need to take pills, keep track of symptoms when they are sick, and add people as guests (like dogsitters).

# Dogs Have Different Profiles
A user will be able to add dogs with their own seperate information and individual profiles to help keep track of every need each dog has individually. The profile can have information about their name, weight, breed, and vets number.

# Tracking Vaccines
Vaccines need to be given to dogs at certain times of their lives. This app will keep track of the age of the dog as well as the date so that it can notify the user when their dogs need vaccines.

# Adding Other People as Guests
Not everyone wants to leave their dogs at a kennel when they have to travel. And not everyone can bring their dogs with them when they travel. In these cases most people hire dogsitters to watch after their pets. To make it easier on the sitter and give the owner peace of mind for them to add the sitter to their Doggio as a guest so the sitter can check instructions for the dogs and things they need to do.

# Feeding Schedule and Amount of Food
Users can add a feeding schedule for their dogs. This would be especially useful when the user has a dogsitter. This can help the sitter remember what the dog or dogs need without the owner having to write everything down on paper that could be lost. Users can also add the amount of food the dog needs or track their food consumption to prevent obesity.

# Pills
Dog need pills when they get sick or get old. This app will have the ability to track when the pills need to be taken and instrucions for the pills. It can also have the name of the pills and possible side effects of the pills to look out for.

# Symptom Tracking
Users can also note the symptoms of dogs when the owner believes their sick. This includes: how long its been happening, how often its been happening, and descriptions of the symptom. Later on in development I hope to have the app look up the symptoms and return possible diseases to ask their vet about.
